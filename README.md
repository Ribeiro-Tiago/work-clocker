# Work Clocker

***A KISS Time Card program***

[**Work Clocker**](https://github.com/Ribeiro-Tiago/work-clocker) is a "timecard punch" app to allow workers to better manage their time to 
avoid working more than the 8 hours they need to. Among other things, tells you when you can leave, taking into account the starting time, 
lunch duration and duration of a regular work day.
